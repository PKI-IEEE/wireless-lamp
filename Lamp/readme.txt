LPCX1343_cmsis2_blinky
======================
This project contains a LED flash example for the LPCXpresso board
mounted with an LPC1343 Cortex-M3 part.

When downloaded to the board and executed, LED2 will flash at regular
intervals using one of the LPC1343's 16 bit timers
 
The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- CMSISv2p00_LPC13xx : for CMSIS 2.00 files relevant to LPC13xx
- LPC13xx_cmsis2_Lib : for LPC13xx peripheral driver files

These two library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that this example project is intended for use with Red Suite /
LPCXpresso IDE v4.0 or later. Use of this project with earlier 
versions of the Code Red IDE is not recommended or supported.
